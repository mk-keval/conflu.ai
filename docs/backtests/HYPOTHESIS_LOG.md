# Hypothesis & Experiment Log

**Purpose:** one place to see every strategy question this project has tested, how
it was tested, and whether the result is allowed to influence a decision. The log
exists to stop three failure modes: citing a superseded backtest, treating an
in-sample what-if as evidence, and quietly re-testing the same idea until it looks
good.

**Rule:** an experiment is logged **before** it is run. A result without a
pre-declared question is exploratory by definition, no matter how good it looks.

## Labels

| Label | Meaning | Can it change a live decision? |
|---|---|---|
| **Confirmatory** | Pre-registered, out-of-sample, forward | Yes — this is the evidence the kill rule uses |
| **Exploratory** | In-sample, post-hoc, or a what-if | No — it generates the next hypothesis |
| **Measurement** | Fixes what is recorded, not what is traded | No decision change; may correct reported numbers |
| **Superseded / invalid** | The engine or data was wrong | No — historical context only |

The forward sample (`FWD-v0.1`) is the only confirmatory experiment. Everything
else in this file is input to the review, never a verdict.

## What each experiment actually tested

### H-01 — D-61 elite template deployment (invalid)

**Question:** which of the 21 templates have a deployable edge?

**What happened:** the original engine reported PF 3–52 and 12 "elite" templates.
D-70 found the engine had a 4-hour timeframe blind spot, silently skipped rules it
could not evaluate, and used look-ahead/collapsed exits. The numbers were not
reproducible under honest mechanics.

**Consequence:** every D-61 statistic is retired. `config/regime_screens.yaml`
still carries a caveat banner; weights were not re-tuned (user decision). Do not
cite D-61 in any review.

---

### H-02 — D-70 honest template validation (exploratory)

**Question:** with honest mechanics (full rule objects, per-rule timeframes,
next-open entries, ATR 2.0/3.0 exits, 15-bar cap, costs), do the deployed
templates still show positive expectancy?

**Design:** 19 templates × 30 symbols, trailing ~700 days, 0 capacity violations.
This is in-sample validation on a fixed symbol list — not a forward test and not a
portfolio simulation.

**Result:** expectancy +0.07…+0.33R, PF 1.0–1.9. The deployed set is mostly
positive; `bull-flag-continuation` is the weakest deployed template (PF 1.15);
only `breakdown` (short, not deployed) is negative.

**What it supports:** the templates are not obviously broken under honest
mechanics. **What it does not support:** that the deployed *system* (screens +
gate + sizing + exits) makes money. H-03 tests that; it does not.

`docs/backtests/validation_20261019_191610.json`.

### H-03 — D-71 two-month replay (exploratory)

**Question:** if the deployed screens had run over the last two months, with
as-of regime selection and honest execution, what would the ledger look like?

**Design:** 503-name S&P 500, 60 days, regime computed as of each signal day,
screen mix parity-tested against the live selector, next-open entries, ATR 2/3
exits, 15-bar cap, 10 + 5 bps per side, dedupe per symbol/day. Separate
`replay_runs` / `replay_trades` tables.

**Result:** 371 trades, 114 W / 257 L, WR 30.7%, expectancy −0.203R, PF 0.63,
−$99.8k at 1% risk. 242 of 371 trades (65%) and ~94% of the dollar loss came from
choppy-regime sessions; every deployed choppy screen lost ≈ −0.35R. Only
`statistical-mean-reversion` (+0.162R), `institutional-trend-follower-mtf`
(+0.183R, 6 trades) and `trend-follower-v2` (+0.021R, 9 trades) were positive.

**What it supports:** the deployed menu is structurally mismatched to chop; the
gate is not the only problem. **What it does not support:** a forward verdict.
TradingView cannot be rewound, so the replay does not reproduce the live brief
(ranking, confluence, catalysts, gate) and its universe/execution differ.

**Critical caveat:** the replay has no gate. It enters every signal. A negative
replay is a statement about the screens, not about the gated live system.

### H-04 — What-if family (exploratory, in-sample)

**Question:** which single design change most improves the replay's negative
expectancy?

**Design:** re-ran the cached replay window with one change at a time. Baseline
reproduced the stored run exactly. R-multiples are gross; dollar P&L is net of the
same costs.

| Variant | Trades | WR (net) | Exp R (gross) | PF | Net P&L | Choppy exp R |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| baseline | 371 | 30.7% | −0.203 | 0.63 | −$99,788 | −0.322 |
| wide target (4.5 ATR) | 361 | 29.1% | −0.179 | 0.68 | −$88,532 | −0.322 |
| choppy = full ranging menu | 534 | 36.0% | −0.123 | 0.76 | −$100,146 | −0.168 |
| ranging menu + wide target | 528 | 35.2% | −0.089 | 0.83 | −$81,268 | −0.144 |
| choppy = mean-reversion only | 332 | 39.8% | −0.015 | 0.97 | −$26,427 | −0.038 |

**What it supports:**

- Menu routing alone is not the fix: the full ranging menu halves per-trade chop
  bleed but takes 67% more chop trades, so total dollars are unchanged.
- The single-screen chop variant is near flat gross but still below the ~44% net
  break-even win rate.
- Wider targets help trend/neutral, not chop.
- Sizing reductions cut dollar damage but do not change R.

**What it does not support:** any claim that one of these variants is deployable.
Five variants on one 60-day window is a multiple-comparisons exercise; the best
row is the most likely to be noise. These are hypotheses for the review, not a
menu recommendation.

`run_replay_experiments.py`.

### H-05 — D-72 execution v0.1 (measurement)

**Question:** can the live path record what it actually decided (screen,
confluence, sector, regime, time stop)?

**Result:** yes. Attribution now comes from the brief ticker (not the verdict),
sector from the analysis response (the 30% cap binds), `max_hold_days` is stored
and executed as calendar days, and the 3 legacy rows are flagged
`exclude_from_stats=1`.

**Not a strategy test.** It did not change targets, the R:R gate, screens,
sizing or regime permission.

---

### H-06 — D-73 pending orders (measurement, pre-sample)

**Question:** were the first four forward entries real?

**Result:** no. PM and AMGN were booked far below the session low; CCK and MMM
were same-day fills after an after-close signal (look-ahead). All four are voided
and visible (`voided=1`, `exclude_from_stats=1`). The execution model is now:
pending limit at `entry_low`, T+1 or later fills only, 3-session expiry,
same-session stop but no same-session target.

**Consequence:** the forward clock restarts at the first actual fill (2026-10-22,
SF @ 65.40). The pre-correction runs remain in `workflow_runs` as history; they are
not evidence.

---

### H-07 — D-74 P0 measurement (measurement)

**Question:** do the reported dollar P&L and the stored plan geometry match what
actually happened?

**Result:** no, on both counts.

- `pnl_usd` multiplied R by **notional** instead of dollar risk. CRS reported
  −$1,624.99; the actual gross was −$25.17 and net −$30.01.
- The gate's R:R and the journal's stored-plan R:R did not reconcile (CRS 4.32 vs
  11.89; IOSP 6.15 vs 3.99; SF 6.47 vs 4.36). The gate used a `risk_reward` value
  that was not always the last stored target; `target_3` was never persisted.
- The live path recorded gross dollars while the backtests recorded net.

**What changed:** a canonical P&L module, `pnl_gross_usd` / `costs_usd` /
`plan_rr` / `target_1_r` / `target_3` columns, a backfill, and
`scripts/verify_journal.py` as a PASS/FAIL gate. No trading decision changed.

---

### H-08 — FWD-v0.1 forward sample (confirmatory, active)

**Question:** does the deployed system produce positive expectancy on real,
tradeable forward fills?

**Pre-registration:** [PRE_REGISTRATION.md](../PAPER_TRADING/PRE_REGISTRATION.md).
**Current state:** 1 closed (CRS −1.00R, MFE +3.72R), 2 open (SF, IOSP), 1 pending
(DUK). Expectancy −1.00R; net −$30.01; kill rule not yet (1/30).

**This is the only row in the log that can kill the system.** It is deliberately
underpowered today. The correct statement is "no verdict", not "negative
expectancy confirmed."

---

### H-09 — D-78 H-09 replay: v0.1 vs v0.2 geometry (exploratory, frozen)

**Backfilled 2026-11-11 from [D-78](../DECISIONS/D-78-h09-replay-freeze.md).**

**Question:** on one signal stream, does the v0.2 geometry plus exit policy beat
v0.1, or does it just reject more trades?

**Design:** the D-71 entry stream over the frozen window 2026-08-20 to
2026-10-19, planned twice on shared signal-close geometry (entry band, stop
`C − 2.0×ATR`, D-73 limit fill). v0.1 reproduces the live midpoint gate and
`infer_exit`; v0.2 applies the nearest structural T1 inside the family band,
the family Plan-R floor and the D-77 exit policy. Only gate step 5 is replayable.

**Result (dry run, censored):** 147 fills; v0.1 accepted 120, v0.2 accepted 103
(44 rejected: target too close 15, too far 24, no structural objective 5).
v0.2 accepted −0.138R vs v0.1 accepted −0.050R; exit-only on 103 paired fills
−0.138R vs −0.096R; the 44 rejected plans' v0.1 counterfactual was +0.012R.

**What it supports:** v0.2's exit policy did not add value on this window and
v0.2 rejected marginally profitable v0.1 trades. **What it does not support:**
any v0.2 verdict. Evidence label `exploratory_h09_not_evidence`; never the
scorecard, D-75 bar, kill rule or `/expectancy`. Earliest full write:
2026-11-24 (36-day horizon). Artifacts:
`docs/backtests/h09_replay_20261030_150747.json` and `..._151453.json`.

### H-10 — D-79 research baseline: four setups vs controls (invalid as recorded)

**Question:** does any of the four setup signal streams beat random, permuted or
time-shifted controls on the S&P 500 snapshot?

**Design:** standalone `backend/app/research` harness. Daily bars, signal at
close, next-open entry, 2.0 ATR stop, 3.0 ATR target, 15-bar hold, 0.5% equity
risk, 8 positions, 20% notional cap, 15 bps/side. Controls: random 2%/day
(100 runs), permuted signal dates (50), time-shifted +20..+60 bars (5). p-value
one-sided on `r_net_sum`.

**Result as recorded:** trade-level mean net R and profit factor:

| Setup | n | Win rate | Mean net R | PF | random p | permuted p | shifted p |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| statistical_mean_reversion | 700 | 49.0% | +0.038 | 1.076 | 0.524 | 0.286 | 0.476 |
| breakout_52week | 583 | 43.9% | -0.047 | 0.915 | 0.143 | **0.048** | **0.048** |
| low_vol_setup | 589 | 46.3% | -0.034 | 0.937 | **0.048** | 0.190 | 0.095 |
| volume_trend_accumulation | 748 | 48.3% | +0.012 | 1.024 | 0.762 | 0.905 | 0.667 |

**Why this row is invalid:**

1. **Mixed cache panel.** `download_daily()` reused cache files without checking
   the requested span. 440/498 files cover only 2020; 40 cover 2014-2024. The
   artifact calendar is 2014-01-02 to 2024-12-30, not "2020-2023".
   `low_vol_setup` and `volume_trend_accumulation` have no entries after 2020.
2. **Stranded positions.** Open positions at a symbol's data end are never
   closed, so the equity curve loses their value. Statistical mean reversion has
   +$10,977 realized P&L but a final equity of $52,552 (-47.4%). The same cache
   contains 395 post-2020 low-vol signals and 859 post-2020 volume-trend
   signals, but both artifacts record zero post-2020 trades: the stranded
   positions consumed the cash. All return/drawdown/CAGR/volatility/alpha/beta
   fields are unusable.

**What it supports (provisional only):** within each run the control comparison
is like-for-like, so "no setup beat its controls at p < 0.05 in the favorable
direction" is the least fragile reading. The two significant p-values are
**unfavorable**. **What it does not support:** the committed return figures, the
"all setups lose money vs buy-and-hold" claim, or any deployment/weight change.

**Artifacts:** `docs/backtests/research/{setup}_20261110_*.json` (see the
[artifact banner](research/README.md)). **Status:** invalid as recorded; re-run
on one clean panel after the D-79 fixes, then replace this row.

## Evidence hierarchy

```
FWD-v0.1 forward journal          ← only confirmatory evidence; kill rule lives here
  ↑
D-73 execution model              ← makes forward fills honest
  ↑
D-70 honest templates             ← makes backtest mechanics believable
  ↑
D-71 replay / H-04 what-ifs       ← exploratory; hypotheses only
  ↑
D-61 (invalid)                    ← do not cite
```

Replay and what-if rows are stored in separate tables and never feed the
scorecard. A backtest can suggest a change; only the forward sample can justify
keeping it.

---

## Hypotheses carried into the forward review

These are the questions the sample is designed to inform. They were fixed on
2026-10-19 (review file) and are not new.

| ID | Hypothesis | Falsified if | Review item |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-A | The static exit leaves R on the table because T1 is far and there is no trail | MFE ≈ realized R across closed trades | A |
| R-B | The choppy menu is mismatched; mean reversion is benched | Forward choppy trades are not worse than neutral/trend | B |
| R-C | Screen edges are regime-specific, not universal | A screen is consistently positive across regimes | C |
| R-D | The gate adds selection value | Rejected candidates outperform accepted ones | D |

Current directional evidence: R-A is supported by one trade (CRS +3.72R MFE →
−1.00R realized), which is an anecdote, not a sample. R-B/R-C are supported only
by the replay. R-D has no forward counterfactual yet.

---

## Rules for the next entry

1. Write the question and the metric **before** running the test.
2. Change one thing at a time; keep the rest of the configuration fixed.
3. Record n, window, universe, costs and artifact path.
4. Label it exploratory unless it is an out-of-sample forward test.
5. If it changes a live decision, it is not an experiment — it is a new sample.
6. Do not re-run a failed what-if with a new window until it passes; that is
   fitting, not testing.
